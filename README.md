a splitted fullscreen variant of the classic DOOM stbar, powered by Nugget Doom


![README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liPillON/nughud_split/main/NUGHUD_split_classic.png)


## Features:
- the classic DOOM statusbar, now available in "splitted fullscreen" mode (inspired by [this](https://github.com/3saster/fullscrn_huds) GZDoom HUD)
- a "modern arrangement" variant is available, where player status and arsenal are on opposite screen corners ([preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liPillON/nughud_split/main/NUGHUD_split_modern.png))
- repositioned all text widgets (including messages and secret/milestone notifications) taking advantage of the "stack" feature
- pwad-provided statusbars are supported (haven't tested all of them of course, some might result misaligned)


## Limitations:
- this is a singleplayer-only HUD, since I haven't tested it in any other game mode
- for optimal results, use the "dark overlay" automap mode  
- when more than 3 powerup are active, the timers widget might overlap with the statusbar chunks
- the rendering stats widgets takes a lot of space and its position might not be ideal
